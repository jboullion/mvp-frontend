# Description

This is a basic Vue 3 front end which has everything setup to hit the ground running on a new CRUD application.

Folder structure and basic framework of the application including: Services, Types, Routing, Tailwind, Authentication, PWA, etc.

When paired with the [MVP-Backend](https://github.com/jboullion/mvp-backend/) you will have an application with a home page, a login page, A basic admin area, the ability to create, read, update, and delete jobs.

This should give you a great starting place for your next prototype or MVP!
